# FacetWP + BigCommerce integration

This plugin allows you to create facets using [BigCommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/bigcommerce/) taxonomies, custom fields and options.

### Usage

After activating the plugin, create a new facet. You'll see a **BigCommerce** header within the facet's `Data Source` dropdown, letting you choose a BigCommerce field to use.

### How it works

This plugin grabs all BigCommerce-related fields and uses them to populate a facet's `Data Source` dropdown. The plugin also automatically parses (and unserializes) any BigCommerce fields during the indexing process.
